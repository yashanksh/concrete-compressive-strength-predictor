# CONCRETE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH ESTIMATOR

Concrete is one of the most important materials in Civil Engineering. Knowing the compressive strength of concrete is very important when constructing a building or a bridge. The Compressive Strength of Concrete is a highly nonlinear function of ingredients used in making it and their characteristics. Thus, using Machine Learning to predict the Strength could be useful in generating a combination of ingredients which result in high Strength.

## 1. Problem Statement
Predicting Compressive Strength of Concrete given its age and quantitative measurements of ingredients.

## 2. Data Description

Data is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* Number of instances - 1030
* Number of Attributes - 9
* Attribute breakdown - 8 quantitative inputs, 1 quantitative output

#### Attribute information
##### Inputs
* Cement
* Blast Furnace Slag
* Fly Ash
* Water
* Superplasticizer
* Coarse Aggregate
* Fine Aggregate

All above features measured in kg/m^3

* Age (in days)

##### Output
* Concrete Compressive Strength (Mpa)

## 3. Modeling and Evaluation

* Algorithms used
  * Ridge Regression
  * GradientBoosting Regression
  * Random Forests Regression

* Metric - Since the target variable is a continuous variable, regression evaluation metric RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination) have been used.
